//NB // JONAS used " // query = query.sort('-createdAt');" for the sorting but it did not work for me when i needed it for //E) MAKING BETTER PAGINATN.
// So chatgpt helped me and said it was better to use  query = query.sort('_id'); rather than query = query.sort('-createdAt'); and it worked.

// THIS IS FOR THIS LECTURE:
// In this video i wanna quickly refactor the API features that we've implemented over the last couple of lectures.
// Now this is not only to make our code a bit cleaner, it's also to make it more modular and more reusable in future.
// So, right now, we have all this code for the features that we built b4 in this the 'getAllTours()'. And this looks
// a bit messy and a bit hard to understand. And also imagine that we wanted to use these same features for another
// resource. For e.g, for the users or, later, for the reviews.It would be not very practical to, basically, copy the
// code from here and use it then in the other resources.
// And so,what i am gonna do is to create a class where i will add one mthd for each of these API features of fclts.
// So i am going to do that here now but later i will make it a reusable module which we can later on, import into
// other controllers.
//We then put the created class into another file "apsFeatures.js" in the "utils folder" and import it as a module
/////

//Importing the Tour from tourModel
const Tour = require('./../models/tourModel'); // "./"=> current folder, "../"=>Go up 1 folder

//Importing apsFeatures.js as a module
// 1) BUILDING A QUERY

exports.aliasTopTours = (req, res, next) => {
  // we are manipulating the query object, so that when it reaches the getAllTours() handler, it's then already dift
  req.query.limit = '5'; // Getting the limit from the query
  req.query.sort = '-ratingsAverage,price'; // Getting the sort from the query
  req.query.fields = 'name,price,ratingsAverage,summary,difficulty'; // We are also specifying sm fields here and not all,
  // so the user doesnot get access to all that we have
  next();
};
// We can do more with alias route but there is no need here,i just want to show u the power of MIDDLEWARE and ALIAS routing
