// From the 18 lecture, that's when i started creating each folder for the lesson bcos we are working with the MVC architecture, which
// may require updating dift parts of the project. So for me remember how the codes were, that's why i started working in dift folders.

/// NOW IF U HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE CODES U CAN WATCH THE VIDEOS FOE THE PARTS

// THIS IS FOR THIS LECTURE:=> Over to tourController.js and utils/apiFeatures.js.

// SERVING STATIC FILE
// let's now learn how to serve static files with Express.
// What are static Files: It's the files that are sitting in our file sys that we currently cannot access using all the routes.

//CREATING OUR MIDLEWARE FC
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  //a) Doing what we want in the code
  console.log('Hello from the middleware 👋');
  //b) Using the next()

//we can create difft numbers of middleware fc.
//2) 2nd Middleware fc:  In this one below, we want to alter the res()
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  //a) Doing what we want in the code
  req.requestTime = new Date().toISOString(); // Wgat we ae doing here is just to add the current time to the request
  //b) calling the next()

///C) ROUTES
//THIS IS CALLED MOUNTING THE ROUTER

// Exporting our app so we can get it in server.js
