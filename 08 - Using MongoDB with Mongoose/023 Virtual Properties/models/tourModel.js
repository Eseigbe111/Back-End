  {
    // The below means each time the data is outputed as JSON, we want virtuals to be true i.e to be
    // part of the output
    toJSON: { virtuals: true },
    // The below is when the data is outputed as an object
    toObject: { virtuals: true },
  },
  //Ends here
);

// THIS IS FOR THIS LECTURE
// VIRTUAL PPTS: These are basically fields that we can define on our schema but that will not be persisted.So they will not be
// saved into the database in order to save us sm space. And most of the time of course, we want toreally save our data to the
// database, but virtual ppts make a lot of sense for fields that can be derived from one another. For e.g a convertn from miles
// to km. It doesn't make sense to store these two fields in the database if we can easily convert one to the other.
// So let's now define a virtual ppt that contains the tour duratn in weeks. And so that's a field basically that we can easily
// convert from the duratn that we already have in days.

//1)Defining the virtual ppts on the tourSchema
//durationWeeks is the name of the virtual ppt
tourSchema.virtual('durationWeeks').get(function () {
  // I used a regular fc bcos an arrow fc does not have its own this keyword
  ////
  // this is how we calc the duratn in weeks
  return this.duration / 7; // The duratn is in days. 7 is bcos there are 7days in a week.
  //"this" is going to pt to the current doc
  ///
}); // we call the get(), bcos this virtuall ppts will always be created each time that we
// get sm data out of the database. And the get() is called a getter

// To make the virtual ppts created above to work, we need to explicitly define in our schema that we want the virtual ppts in our output.
// And so remember how i said that into this  "new mongoose.Schema({})", we can pass in not only the object with the schema definitn as we
// have already, but also an object for the schema optns i.e " new mongoose.Schema({definitn}, {optns})". So this is what we will do in our
// schema above i.e adding the optns:
/*  Adding the below to the schema, we willbe able to see this Virtual ppts in our postman, when we get ALL Tours
{ 
    toJSON: { virtuals: true },
    toObject: { virtuals: true },
  },
*/

//NB One thing to keep in mind is that u cannot use this virtual ppt 'durationWeeks' in a query bcos they are technically not part of the
// database. So we cannot say, for e.g "Tour.find({'durationWeeks: 1})".

//Ends Here
