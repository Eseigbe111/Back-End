///This is for this lecture
// THis will be coded in  tourRoutes.js and tourController.js

// Importing module of express
const express = require('express');

// Importing morgan
const morgan = require('morgan');

const tourRouter = require('./routes/tourRoutes');
const userRouter = require('./routes/userRoutes');

//  We create a variable called app. Again this is a kind of a standard
// We assign it the result of calling express. This adds a bunch of mthds to our app variable below
const app = express(); // This creates a new instance of express() which is store in app

//
//3rd-PARTY MIDDLEWARE: For this we will use "morgan". Morgan is a popular logging middleware for Express
// that lets you see details about each incoming request (like method, URL, status code, and response time)
// directly in the console i.e smth like this "GET /api/v1/tours 200 4.907 ms - 8681".
// We install by doing "npm i morgan", and we use it as below:
app.use(morgan('dev'));
// Morgan is res

//

// EXPRESS MIDDLEWARES
// Telling Express to use the JSON body parser middleware
// The below tells Express "Whenever a request comes in with JSON data, please parse it and make it available as req.body."
// If not, we will only see the id of what is created without the body
app.use(express.json());

///////

// MIDDLEWARES
// Middleware: A function in Express that runs between a request and a response. It can modify the request, the response, or
// stop or pass the flow to the next function.
// NB: You can modify data without middleware, but middleware is the standard way to do it in Express because it lets you
// handle data before it reaches your routes.
// To use a middleware, we need to use "app.use()"  just like this "app.use(express.json());" above

// 1) 1st MIDDLEWARE: So this middleware will be logged on the terminal of vsc each time we send a req i.e in our POstman
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Hello from the middleware ');
  next(); // without this next() we will have an unending req-res cycle
});

//2) 2nd MIDDLEWARE: So here we want to add time parameter to our req and we will call this in getAllTours()
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.requestTime = new Date().toISOString();
  next();
});
